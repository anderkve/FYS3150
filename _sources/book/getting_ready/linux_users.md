# Linux users

We recommend that you use Ubuntu as your chosen Linux distribution, unless you are already familiar with some other distribution.


## Install software for code development

If you're using Ubuntu, just copy and run the following command in your terminal. This should install the software packages you'll need for coding during the course.

```sh
sudo apt install make git python3-pip gcc g++ cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libarpack2-dev libsuperlu-dev libarmadillo-dev libomp-dev
```

<!--
## Install LaTeX

If you want to write and build LaTeX documents locally on your computer (as opposed to using an online service like Overleaf), you need to install the software necessary to compile `.tex` files. The following command should install all the required packages for you.

```sh
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

If you prefer using a specialized IDE (integrated development environment) for writing and building LaTeX documents, you can for instance use TexStudio. (But note that there are many other alternatives available.) To install TexStudio, run this command:

```sh
sudo apt install texstudio
```
