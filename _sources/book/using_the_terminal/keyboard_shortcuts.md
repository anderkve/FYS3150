## Keyboard shortcuts

Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts for working in the terminal:

- **Abort a running command:** 
  - *Linux and macOS:* Use **ctrl+c** to abort a command. You can test this by running the silly command `sleep 10` (does nothing for ten seconds) and abort it with **ctrl+c** before it finishes.

- **Repeat previous commands:** 
  - *Linux and macOS:* Use **up** and **down** to cycle through previous commands.

- **Auto-complete file/directory names:** 
  - *Linux and macOS:* Use **tab** to auto-complete long file/directory names. If there are multiple possible matches, press **tab** twice to see the alternatives.

- **Move cursor word by word:** 
  - *Linux:* Use **ctrl+right** and **ctrl+left**
  - *macOS:* Use **alt+right** and **alt+left**

- **Jump to the beginning/end of the line:**
  - *Linux and macOS:* Use **ctrl+a** and **ctrl+e**

- **Delete everything after the cursor:**
  - *Linux and macOS:* Use **ctrl+k**. Thus, a quick way to clear the command line is to press **ctrl+a** and then **ctrl+k**. (Or you can press **ctrl+c**.)

- **Copy/paste:**
  - *Linux:* Use **ctrl+shift+c** and **ctrl+shift+v**
  - *macOS:* Use **cmd+c** and **cmd+v**

- **Search previous commands:** 
  - *Linux and macOS:* Press **ctrl+r** and start typing a command. You can press **ctrl+r** again to cycle through alternative matches. Once you found it, press **ctrl+j** or an arrow key to start editing the command.

- **Clear the terminal screen:**
  - *Linux and macOS:* Press **ctrl+l**. You can also do this by running the command `clear`.
