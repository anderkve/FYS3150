### main_threadsafety.cpp

Simple example code that illustrates how a code can be
*non-threadsafe* unless you pay attention to whether a 
variable is *shared* among threads (all threads 
modify same variable in memory) or *private* 
(each thread is working with its own separate instance 
of the variable.)

- Uncomment one of the code parts in the example (part 1, 2 or 3)

- Build with: 
  ```sh
  g++ main_threadsafety.cpp -fopenmp -o main_threadsafety
  ```

- We can set the number of threads to use by setting the environment 
  variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. One option is to do this with the command `export`
  before we run our program:
  ```sh
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
  ./main_threadsafety
  ```

- Another option is to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` at the beginning of the command for 
  running our program:
  ```sh
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./main_threadsafety
  ```

- To see example of thread-unsafe code, uncomment part 2 of the code, 
  recompile and run as follows:
  ```sh
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=10 ./main_threadsafety > output.txt    # piping the output to a file
  cat output.txt                     # look at the output 
  cat output.txt | grep "thread: 2"  # look at output for thread 2
  ```

- You will probably see that for many of the threads, other threads have
  incremented the value of x between every increment from the thread you
  are looking at. 


### main_no_omp.cpp

A dummy example program with a two-loop structure. The outer loop is
a loop over `n_A` values of some variable `A`, from `A_min` to `A_max`. 

For each value of `A`, there is an inner loop counting up to `n_cycles` 
and doing a dummy computation with that `A` value as input. 

This example code in `main_no_omp.cpp` is *not* parallelised.

- Build with:
  ```sh
  g++ -O3 main_no_omp.cpp -o main_no_omp
  ```

- Run as:
  ```sh
  ./main_no_omp <A_min> <A_max> <n_A> <n_cycles> <output_file_name>
  ```

- To run an example that takes a little bit of time 
  (~40 seconds on my laptop), try for instance this:
  ```sh
  ./main_no_omp 0.0 4.0 401 2000000 output.dat
  ```

- To time it, run it through the "time" command:
  ```sh
  time ./main_no_omp 0.0 4.0 401 2000000 output.dat
  ```
  (Focus on the "real" row of the time output.)


This non-parallelised program can be used to demonstrate the simplest 
(and sometimes useful) approach to parallelisation, namely just 
running multiple instances of the same program with different inputs 
(and writing to different output files). 

- For instance you start the same program from two different terminal 
  windows, with different input/output:
  ```sh
  time ./main_no_omp 0.0 2.0 201 2000000 output.dat.part1
  time ./main_no_omp 2.01 4.0 200 2000000 output.dat.part2
  ```
  and then combine the data files into one by doing e.g. this:
  ```sh
  cat output.dat.part1 output.dat.part2 > output.dat
  ```

To be a bit more fancy, you can do everything from one terminal window 
by starting separate runs "in the background" by adding `&` to the command.

  - Try starting two runs in the background like this
    ```sh
    ./main_no_omp 0.0 2.0 201 2000000 output.dat.part1 &
    ./main_no_omp 2.01 4.0 200 2000000 output.dat.part2 &
    ```

- To see the running jobs, run the command `jobs` command.

- To abort a running job, you can either kill the process code 
  (use the `top` command), or bring the job to the foreground 
  (`fg` command), e.g. do this to stop job number 1:
  ```sh
  jobs
  fg 1
  <ctrl-c>
  ```  

- Again output files can be combined with `cat`:
  ```sh
  cat output.dat.part1 output.dat.part2 > output.dat  
  ```


### main_omp_outer_loop.cpp

Similar to `main_no_omp.cpp`, but now using OpenMP to parallelise the 
outer loop. The line `#pragma omp for` divides the outer for loop
among the available threads.

To avoid thread conflicts in the output, the code is set up so that 
each thread writes data to it's own output file. These files can then
be combined later, e.g. using the `cat` command.

- Build like this (note the `-fopenmp` flag):
  ```sh
  g++ -O3 main_omp_outer_loop.cpp -fopenmp -o main_omp_outer_loop
  ```

- Run like this:
  ```sh
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./main_omp_outer_loop <A_min> <A_max> <n_A> <n_cycles_per_thread> <output_file_name>
  ```

- A run that includes timing with the `time` command could be:
  ```sh
  time OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./main_omp_outer_loop 0.0 4.0 401 2000000 output.dat
  ```

- Look at the output files


### main_omp_outer_loop_inmem.cpp

Similar to `main_omp_outer_loop.cpp`, but now storing the results 
from all threads in memory during the run (in a shared armadillo 
matrix) and only writing a single output file at the end.

- Build like this (now also with the `-laramdillo` flag):
  ```sh
  g++ -O3 main_omp_outer_loop_inmem.cpp -fopenmp -o main_omp_outer_loop_inmem
  ```

- Run like this:
  ```sh
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./main_omp_outer_loop_inmem <A_min> <A_max> <n_A> <n_cycles_per_thread> <output_file_basename>
  ```

### main_omp_inner_loop.cpp

Similar to `main_omp_outer_loop.cpp`, but now using OpenMP 
to parallelise the inner loop (a loop with `n_cycles_per_thread`
iterations). 

As the variable name suggestes, in this example we treat 
`n_cycles_per_thread` as the number of cycles *per thread*, 
i.e. we don't use `#pragma omp for` to split up the inner loop.
This is then an example of performing similar computations on 
each thread and taking an average as the combined result.

(For instance, in the case of MCMC, the threads could 
represent independent "walkers" that each should perform 
`n_cycles_per_thread` iterations of the MCMC algorithm, 
before the combined results are formed.)

In this example the results from different threads are 
combined before the parallel block ends, and then just 
the single (main) thread writes to file, so no need for 
multiple output files.

- Build like this:
  ```sh
  g++ -O3 main_omp_inner_loop.cpp -fopenmp -o main_omp_inner_loop
  ```

- Run like this:
  ```sh
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./main_omp_inner_loop <A_min> <A_max> <n_A> <n_cycles_per_thread> <output_file_name>
  ```
