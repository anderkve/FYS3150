At the end of the lecture on Aug. 23 2024 we discussed variable scopes and encountered a slightly confusing case: It illustrated how things can go wrong if you have two variables of different type but with the same name. In the code example in `main.cpp` we have added a bunch of comments that explain what was going on in this case.

To build and run the example, do:

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

Then compare the output to what is discussed in the code comments.
