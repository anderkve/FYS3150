# Welcome

On this page, we will collect relevant material for the course **FYS3150/FYS4150 -- Computational Physics** at the University of Oslo (UiO). Note that the pages are in active development -- we will add more material here as the course progresses.

This page is based on our FYS3150 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anderkve/FYS3150). We'll use the [Issues page](https://github.com/anderkve/FYS3150/issues) of this repo as a discussion forum for questions and technical troubleshooting. Feel free to post new questions and to answer any questions from your fellow students.

The official UiO webpage for the course is [here](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h24/index.html). *Make sure to check that page regularly, as all course messages will be posted there.*
